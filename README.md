# Parkinsons_Project_ML

Parkinson’s Classification Model
Parkinson’s is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. The symptoms are rigidity, tremor, slowness, difficulty in movement. In this study I try to build a model to detect Parkinson’s Disorder in a person using their voice.
Motivation behind the study: About 10 million people suffer from parkinsons worldwide. The symptoms of parkinsons appear at a very late stage where the treatment costs go up significantly. Moreover I wanted to build an app to detect parkinson’s disorder  at the early stage.
Dataset: The Dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website. This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). There are 195 rows and 24 columns.
Objective 1: To detect Parkinson’s Disorder in an individual using the voice recording.
Pandas methods used: .info(),.describe(),.isnull.sum(),.drop()
Graphs Used: Correlation heatmap, Jointplot,Pie Chart
Models Used: KNN,Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Decision Tree with entropy, Support Vector Classifier, XGBOOST, Random Forest Classifier,Voting Classifier( Hard and soft)
